description: '"The rural tranquillity of the lonely, pine-girthed shores of the Maine
  coast is the setting for this beautiful novel of conflicting aspirations written
  by one of the most prolific and influential writers in American history. Here is
  the heartwarming story of a young girl''s struggle to belong and fit in, in the
  face of adversity, and of her upbringing among strong women, grumpy fishermen, annoying
  gossips, sea captains, and the dreamlike, temptestuous landscape of Orr''s Island."
